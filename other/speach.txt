hello, everyone.

I tejashree dumasia with my team members ajit, disha, and Aryan student of modern college of engineering

Today we are presenting our project — Priority Scheduling Simulator — developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project aims to demonstrate how the Priority Scheduling algorithm works in operating systems through a simple and interactive web-based simulator."





"Priority Scheduling is an important CPU scheduling technique where each process is assigned a priority. The CPU is always allocated to the process with the highest priority.

Our goal was to create an educational tool that helps users, especially students, to better understand how processes are managed based on their priorities.

Instead of just reading about the concept, users can now interact with the processes, simulate different scenarios, and visualize how scheduling decisions are made."



First, on the landing page, users can learn about Priority Scheduling through different sections like Overview, Features, Advantages, Disadvantages, Real-World Applications, and Improvements.


Second, on the Simulation page, users can actually run a simulation. They can:

-	Add processes by specifying Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority.
-	Play, pause, speed up, slow down, and restart the simulation.
-	View the Gantt Chart that dynamically updates as the scheduling happens.
-	See a summary table with calculated values like Completion Time (CT), Turnaround Time (TAT), and Waiting Time (WT)."


----
Lets run a sample simulation on given example
[[[[run the simulation]]]]

As you can see, once we run the simulation, the processes are executed based on their assigned priority values.
The process with the highest priority (lowest priority number) is scheduled first.
On the screen, we can observe the Gantt Chart, which visually represents the order in which processes are executed over time.
Below the simulation, the summary table shows important details of process and there updated Wait time, Turnaround time


Thank you for watching our presentation! We hope you enjoyed this simulation and that it helps you better understand how Priority Scheduling works in operating systems."
